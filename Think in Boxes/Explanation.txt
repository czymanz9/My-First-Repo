	As I am breaking down the sections of the youtube page that I took, I first identified the big blocks that is easily seen in the page. The header which contains the navbar, sidebar, main video grid, and shorts section. I also inspected the website and found how they named the contents in the header like the logo’s class is named start while the search bar is called center and the user profile icon in called end. I think flex is implemented there or something similar since it looks like it. In addition, I cannot find the footer, I keep scrolling down and it just loads more videos. 

	The way that I broke down the layout was after identifying the big blocks, I then proceeded to identify the sub-sections. It was kind of easy for me to identify since it was obvious on how those sections are separated. There were labels for each section that’s why it was somewhat obvious. Furthermore, the layout was also clean and not hard to understand so it made me do my faster. Using the inspect in the website also helped me give an insight on the structure of the website.
