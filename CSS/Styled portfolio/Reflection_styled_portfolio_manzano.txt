I had fun designing it, I tried different variations on the customization that I added like trying what would it look like if I made the pixel into 100 or changing the colors. My favorite style in this code was how the gradient, which was blue to pink was incorporated into my sections, like how in each section the colors are different like making it into a subtle gradient as the header. Also when you click the links in the nav, it redirects you to the content and Im proud of it HASHAHA. I also fixed the checkboxes and radio buttons so that my HTML wont be using the br tag.^^
