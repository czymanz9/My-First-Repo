What I did to complete this was to try what I know. At first it was obviously not working since I just added display:flex at everything. But after some thinking and recalling, the parent container is the one controlling how its children are being assembled. After realizing it, it made my code work. I think it took me 30 mins to finish this challenge and I can say that I understand how flexbox work.
